### What I have learned from this project
- Using [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) library to fetch data remotely from the provided API.
- Using [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) to save data persistently in a local database.
- Using [Dagger](https://google.github.io/dagger/) as a dependency injection tool to provide dependencies for classes.
- Using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) libraries and [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) software architectural pattern.
- Using [Android Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) library to bind UI components in layout files to data sources.
- Using [ExoPlayer](http://google.github.io/ExoPlayer/) as an alternative to Android's MediaPlayer API to play videos.
- Transforming provided wireframes into actual user interface for both phone and tablet screen.
- Adding app widget to allow user to quickly use the app from the device home screen.
